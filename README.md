# NYU CSCI-UA 310 — Basic Algorithms (Selected Homeworks)

This repository collects selected homework implementations from **NYU CSCI-UA 310: Basic Algorithms**. The aim isn’t to showcase “big projects,” but to demonstrate clean, correct implementations of classic algorithms, clear problem decompositions, and disciplined testing and documentation. Assignments are organized by folder (e.g., `HW0`, `HW3`, `HW5`, `HW7`). Each folder contains problem statements, working code, and, where relevant, analysis or write-ups.

## Tech & Conventions

* **Languages:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter/CLI as appropriate
* **Style:** Small, readable modules with inline docs and simple tests

## Highlights

* `HW0` — Search algorithms
* `HW3` — Merge sort; Prim’s algorithm; Trie / prefix tree
* `HW5` — Prim’s algorithm
* `HW7` — Prim’s algorithm

## How to Run

Clone the repo and run scripts from their respective folders. For Python:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if provided
python <script>.py
```

Most solutions are self-contained and rely only on the standard library.

## Notes for Reviewers

These are **course exercises** intended to demonstrate algorithmic thinking, correctness, and clarity—not oversized projects. Focus areas include:

* Implementing standard algorithms from scratch (with time/space tradeoffs noted in comments)
* Writing clear, testable functions with edge cases covered
* Documenting rationale and complexity where appropriate
