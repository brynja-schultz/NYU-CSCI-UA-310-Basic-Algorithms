# Basic Algorithms (Java)

*New York University – College of Arts And Science*

## Course Context

This repository contains my programming assignments from **Basic Algorithms** at NYU, **Fall 2023 semester**.
The course covered the design, analysis, and implementation of fundamental algorithms and data structures, with a focus on efficiency and problem-solving strategies.
It built directly on prior programming coursework and laid the groundwork for more advanced topics in artificial intelligence, optimization, and large-scale systems.

**Tech Stack:** Java (JDK) · Standard Java Libraries
