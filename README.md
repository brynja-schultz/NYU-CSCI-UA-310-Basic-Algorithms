# Basic Algorithms (Java)

*New York University – College of Arts And Science*

## Course Context

This repository contains my programming assignments from **Basic Algorithms** at NYU, **Fall 2023 semester**.
The course covered the design, analysis, and implementation of fundamental algorithms and data structures, with a focus on efficiency and problem-solving strategies.
It built directly on prior programming coursework and laid the groundwork for more advanced topics in artificial intelligence, optimization, and large-scale systems.

**Tech Stack:** Java (JDK) · Standard Java Libraries

## Skills Developed

* Analyzing time and space complexity (Big-O notation).
* Designing and implementing algorithms for different problem types.
* Working with core data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
* Applying recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy strategies.
* Implementing and comparing multiple solutions to optimize performance.
* Translating problem statements into clear, efficient Java code.

---

## How to Run

Compile and run using the Java compiler or your preferred IDE:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

(Some assignments may have differently named main classes.)

## What to Look For

* Well-structured, modular code following Java conventions.
* Algorithmic solutions with clear complexity analysis.
* Progressive application of increasingly sophisticated problem-solving techniques.
