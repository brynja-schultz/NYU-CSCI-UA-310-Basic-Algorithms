(3) Integrity Statement:
	1) I needed help with the file handling in Java, so I talked
	to Dr. Marcelo Cicconet who shared the method ReadFile() in ATM.java
	with me.  The rest of the code is work I did myself.
	2) OK, I also took a snippet of code
	from this website: http://javaCheat.com

	I have no other acknowlegements.
