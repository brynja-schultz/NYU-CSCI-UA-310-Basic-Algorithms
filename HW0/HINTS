BirthDay Paradox:
	Hints for writing the program BdayParadox.java:

0) Your goal is to replicate our outputs in the file
				TestOutput
	found in this folder.  

1) We suggest that you process the standard command line arguments
	(ss, nn, mm) following the example of Hello1.java.

2) Similary, you should set up the random number generator using
	seed "ss" following the example of Hello1.java

3) Read JavaNotes.pdf in this folder for other hints.

4) You must NOT randomly generate the days of the year by
	first randomly generating the month (1-12),
	and then randomly generating the day (1-31).
